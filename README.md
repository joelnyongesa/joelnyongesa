# 👋 Hello, I am Joel Nyongesa

I am a software developer with passion for full stack web development. I am currently working with Flask and React to create seamless and fully fledged web applications that solve real world problems. Always eager to learn and contribute equally in team settings.

## 😆 Fun facts

* 💻 My first programming language was C.

* 🍖 I have a soft spot for good food.

* ✍️ I love writing blogs whenever I find some free time. Check out my [Medium blogs](https://medium.com/@joelnyongesa148)

* 📚 I love reading about history, and if I am not writing code or blogs, I am probably watching documentaries about our history.

*As **Konrad Adenauer** says:*
> *"History is the sum total of things that could have been avoided."*
